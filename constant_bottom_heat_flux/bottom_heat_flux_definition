#The bottom heat flux

The bottom heat flux can be put in one of the ANA_*
I copy ROMS/Functionals/ana_btflux.h to my applications folder, edit that file, and add a section such as
IF (itrc.eq.itemp) THEN
DO j=JstrT,JendT
DO i=IstrT,IendT
btflux(i,j,itrc)=0.0_r8 <---- put some other value here
END DO
END DO

I did some tests, so did a run without this first. then added some value, recompiled, and did a second run with tht btflux value. 
diff betwwen the 2 simulations and see if the flux is correct.

The first value is 3/4.18 e^6
The second value is 5/4.18 e^6
