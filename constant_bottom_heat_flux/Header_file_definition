Model problems in first ran: 
Why is the maximum temperature in the run without heating much below 4 degC near the bottom? Or is it because not more contours are shown in the plot?
Maybe use “pcolor” instead of “contourf”, or add more contours for checking the full range of temperatures. Conversely, in the case with heating, the 
temperature in the shallow parts decreases below 0 degC. 
That is curious, either an indication of numerical instability (probably in the vertical advection, this could also explain the decreasing bottom
temperatures), or because there is a mix-up with the signs of the bottom heating and you are actually imposed a cooling. 
Changing the sign on the forcing might help to find it out. If the heating is readily defined correctly, it would not be surprising if the downslope 
flow of dense water imposes an instability in the vertical advection scheme that leads to unphysical temperature values. 
We have seen this before in other applications and we will hopefully / probably be able to cure it by activating the parabolic splines reconstruction
of vertical derivatives (using the “SPLINES_VDIFF” option in the header file).

Note: 
ROMS offers several choices for handling the vertical advection and diffusion of tracer properties. Having tested several of
these options (not shown), the best choice for obtaining a plausible T-S evolution was given by using a conservative, parabolic
splines reconstruction for vertical diffusion on active and passive tracers. Omitting this option leads to the development of
non-physical tracer values in shallow and confined regions near the GL of the ice shelf cavity, typically identified by too
high temperatures near the seafloor and too low temperatures near the ice base (when compared to the meltwater mixing (McDougall et al., 2014), 
ambient water and pressure melting point constraints). Similar behavior has been observed in other contexts using ROMS in static, but more realistic 
ice shelf cavity configurations, e.g. near the Foundation Ice Stream on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (Daae et al., 2020), as well as in static and 
time-evolving ice shelf cavity simulations using FVCOM (Zhou and Hattermann, 2020). Within FVCOM, the use of a positive definite MPDATA vertical
advection scheme successfully suppresses the development of such non-physical tracer values, and our working hypothesis is that the large vertical
gradients that are imposed by the meltwater forcing (and the resultant horizontal divergence in the upper part of the water column with its associated
upwelling near the GL) tend to cause overshoots in the vertical advection-diffusion balance. The use of more conservative numerical schemes, 
as is reported here, may be instructive for other studies, while further investigations might be needed for a more detailed understanding of the cause
of these instabilities.
